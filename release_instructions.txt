'cause I know I'll forget #uwu

Easy way: 
  python new_release.py

Hard Way:
1. Pick new version tag (like v1.0.0.1)
2. Update the FFLogsPartyLookup.json file to contain links to the new release
     - The link won't be valid yet but it will be after you upload the release
3. Run dotnet build /p:Version=1.0.0.1
     - but replace 1.0.0.1 with your version #
4. Go into the Releases folder and create a new folder with the version # name
5. Go into the bin/Debug folder and copy the FFLogsPartyLookup.dll and .json
   files into the Release folder you just created.
     - Double check the download links in the .json are correct (they still
       won't be valid, but make sure they reference the new release you are
       creating)
6. From the release folder, select the new .dll and .json file and right click
   -> send to zipped folder.
7. Push any changes to github now.
8. Create a new release on github with the title "v1.0.0.1" but with your own
   version number and upload the zipped folder you just created. Make sure the
   zipped folder is named "v.1.0.0.1" except with your own version #... ofc...
9. Make sure Dalamud recognizes there is an update to your plugin and that the
   new version is able to load, execute, and unload successfully.

Tada~
